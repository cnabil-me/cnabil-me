# üí´ About Me:
Im a self-taught web developer, I have been passionate about tech and programming for many years, I started by curiosity and loving computers until I became a geek programmer. After years of experience, I went to be a freelancer, and I helped many clients build their applications and websites professionally, and I contributed to many open source project. I always push my self to develop my skills as a programmer by looking at the latest technology news and frameworks and reading their documentation. I use Laravel and Vue JS frameworks as my stack, but I am open to any other technologies. I'm happy to work with you as a freelancer and develop your applications professionally, thank you for your time.
